    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="This example illustrates the effects of different smoothing methods. Smoothing a mesh can serve two purposes - the first is to smooth the geometry, rounding out sharp features; the second is to redistribute nodes, often in pursuit of improved element quality. When attempting to improve element quality, often the goal is to redistribute the nodes while having a minimal effect on the geometry. Different smoothing methods have different effects on the geometry.">
