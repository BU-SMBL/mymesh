Mixed-Topology TPMS
===================
Mixed-topology surfaces :cite:p:`Josephson2024b` combine multiple implicit 
functions by taking weighted sums of the functions. By controlling the weights,
the resulting surface can be varied continuously between the set of surfaces.
Depending on the set of surfaces, this can constitute a low-parameter, 
topology-varying design space that can be used for design optimization (as in
:cite:`Josephson2024b`).

Triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) are particularly
interesting subjects for a mixed-topology approach because the resultant surface
will remain triply periodic (though not minimal) as long as the periodicities
are compatible.  

Such surfaces can be easily generated in MyMesh with the :mod:`~mymesh.implicit` 
module. Several TPMSs are available as built-in functions in :mod:`~mymesh.implicit` 
including :func:`~mymesh.implicit.gyroid`, :func:`~mymesh.implicit.primitive` 
(Schwarz P), and :func:`~mymesh.implicit.diamond` (Schwarz D), or a more generic function :func:`~mymesh.implicit.tpms` that offers a wider variety of functions [#f1]_.

.. [#f1] 
    To be specific, the implicit function TPMS representations are 
    Fourier series approximations (also known as periodic nodal surfaces 
    :cite:p:`VonSchnering1991`) and are not *truly* minimal surfaces (though they 
    are truly triply periodic). This can be seen by measuring the surface curvature
    (:mod:`~mymesh.curvature`) and observing that the mean curvature is not zero at
    all points. Nevertheless, these are reasonably accurate and commonly used 
    approximations.
