abstract = {Synthetic bone graft scaffolds aim to generate new bone tissue and alleviate the limitations of autografts and allografts. To meet that aim, it is essential to have a design approach able to generate scaffold architectures that will promote bone formation. Here, we present a topology-varying design optimization method, the “mixed-topology” approach, that generates new designs from a set of starting structures. This approach was used with objective functions focusing on improving the scaffold's local mechanical microenvironments to mechanobiologically promote bone formation within the scaffold and constraints to ensure manufacturability and achieve desired macroscale properties. The results demonstrate that this approach can successfully generate scaffold designs with improved microenvironments, taking into account different combinations of relevant stimuli and constraints.},

@article{Si2015,
abstract = {TetGen is a C++ program for generating good quality tetrahedral meshes aimed to support numerical methods and scientific computing. The problem of quality tetrahedralmesh generation is challenged by many theoretical and practical issues. TetGen uses Delaunay-based algorithms which have theoretical guarantee of correctness. It can robustly handle arbitrary complex 3D geometries and is fast in practice. The source code of TetGen is freely available. This article presents the essential algorithms and techniques used to develop TetGen. The intended audience are researchers or developers in mesh generation or other related areas. It describes the key software components of TetGen, including an efficient tetrahedral mesh data structure, a set of enhanced local mesh operations (combination of flips and edge removal), and filtered exact geometric predicates. The essential algorithms include incremental Delaunay algorithms for inserting vertices, constrained Delaunay algorithms for inserting constraints (edges and triangles), a new edge recovery algorithm for recovering constraints, and a new constrained Delaunay refinement algorithm for adaptive quality tetrahedral mesh generation. Experimental examples as well as comparisons with other softwares are presented.},

@article{Lorensen1987,
abstract = {We present a new algorithm, called marching cubes, that creates triangle models of constant density surfaces from 3D medical data. Using a divide-and-conquer approach to generate inter-slice connectivity, we create a case table that defines triangle topology. The algorithm processes the 3D medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) illustrate the quality and functionality of marching cubes. We also discuss improvements that decrease processing time and add solid modeling capabilities.},

Several implementation issues are discussed, including the choice of triangulation algorithms and data structures, the effect of several variants of the Delaunay refinement algorithm on mesh quality, and the use of adaptive exact arithmetic to ensure robustness with minimal sacrifice of speed. The problem of triangulating a planar straight line graph (PSLG) without introducing new small angles is shown to be impossible for some PSLGs, contradicting the claim that a variant of the Delaunay refinement algorithm solves this problem.},
