In this paper, we combine the moving mesh smoothing, based on the integration of an ordinary differential equation coming from a given functional, with the lazy flip technique, a reversible edge removal algorithm to modify the mesh connectivity. Moreover, we utilize radial basis function (RBF) surface reconstruction to improve tetrahedral meshes with curved boundary surfaces. Numerical tests show that the combination of these techniques into a mesh improvement framework achieves results which are comparable and even better than the previously reported ones.},

   abstract = {This paper describes a general-purpose, representation-independent method for the accurate and computationally efficient registration of 3-D shapes including free-form curves and surfaces. The method handles the full six degrees of freedom and is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which requires only a procedure to find the closest point on a geometric entity to a given point. The ICP algorithm always converges monotonically to the nearest local minimum of a mean-square distance metric, and experience shows that the rate of convergence is rapid during the first few iterations. Therefore, given an adequate set of initial rotations and translations for a particular class of objects with a certain level of “shape complexity,” one can globally minimize the mean-square distance metric over all six degrees of freedom by testing each initial registration. For example, a given “model” shape and a sensed “data” shape that represents a major portion of the model shape can be registered in minutes by testing one initial translation and a relatively small set of rotations to allow for the given level of model complexity. One important application of this method is to register sensed data from unfixtured rigid objects with an ideal geometric model prior to shape inspection. The described method is also useful for deciding fundamental issues such as the congruence (shape equivalence) of different geometric representations as well as for estimating the motion between point sets where the correspondences are not known. Experimental results show the capabilities of the registration algorithm on point sets, curves, and surfaces. © 1992 IEEE},

An inherent problem of these approximation algorithms is that the resulting curves and surfaces appear faceted. Boundary-following and iso-surface construction algorithms are typical examples. To reduce the apparent faceting, smoothing methods are used. In this paper we introduce a new method for smoothing piece-wise linear shapes of arbitrary dimension and topology. This new method is in fact a linear low-pass filter that removes high curvature variations, and does not produce shrinkage. Its computational complexity is linear in the number of edges or faces of the shape, and the required storage is linear in the number of vertices.},

   abstract = {In this paper we introduce a new algorithm for rasterizing algebraic curves, and we discuss applications to surface and surface-surface intersection rendering and visualization. By rasterizing an algebraic curve we mean to determine which cells, or pixels, from a square mesh of cells in the plane, are cut by a curve represented as the set of zeros of a polynomial in two variables. By using a recursive space subdivision scheme, the problem is be reduced to testing whether the curve cuts a square or not. Other researchers have followed this approach, but their tests are either computationally expensive, or apply just to special cases. Curves with singularities are particularly difficult to deal with, and most know algorithms fail to render these curves correctly. Our contribution in this paper is the introduction of a computationally efficient and asymptotically correct test, which applies not only to dimension two, but also to dimension three and above. We prove that the recursive space subdivision algorithm based on this new test renders a curve of constant width, even in neighborhoods of singular points, and with no missing parts. For example, if f is a polynomial, it produces the same results whether the coefficients of f or f2 are given as input to the algorithm. Not many algorithms satisfy this property. Finally, the same methodology can be applied to compute a set of voxels containing an algebraic surface, and by representing it as a singular surface, space algebraic curves (surface-surface intersections) can be approximated as well. We show examples of these applications. This sets of voxels can be used for tolerance analysis and to compute polyhedral or piecewise linear approximations of the curves or surfaces for interactive rendering purposes as well.},

To control processing time, it is often desirable to use approximations in place of excessively detailed models. We have developed a surface simplification algorithm which can rapidly produce high quality approximations of polygonal models. The algorithm uses iterative contractions of vertex pairs to simplify models and maintains surface error approximations using quadric matrices. By contracting arbitrary vertex pairs (not just edges), our algorithm is able to join unconnected regions of models. This can facilitate much better approximations, both visually and with respect to geometric error. In order to allow topological joining, our system also supports non-manifold surface models.},

Moreover, the desired density of elements in various regions of the problem domain is specified by the user, thus allowing him to obtain a mesh decomposition appropriate to the physical loading and/or boundary conditions of the particular problem at hand. Several examples are presented to illustrate the applicability of the algorithm. An extension of the algorithm to the triangulation of shell structures is indicated.

   abstract = {Goals: To review the literature on chondrocyte movements and to develop plausible hypothesis for further work. Design: Chondrocyte movements are herein defined as translocations of the cell body. A brief overview of cell migration in other cell types is presented to set the stage for a discussion of chondrocyte moves; this includes a discussion of the challenges that cells find when moving within tissues. Reports of isolated chondrocyte migration in vitro (isolated cell systems) and ex vivo (cartilage organ cultures) are then summarized, followed by a discussion of recent studies that infer chondrocyte movements in vivo. Results: Investigators from different laboratories have observed chondrocyte motility in vitro. I became interested in the question of whether articular chondrocytes retained their phenotype during their migratory excursions. We devised a simple method to separate migratory and stationary chondrocytes and then showed that migratory chondrocytes synthesized collagen II but not I - consistent with a differentiated phenotype. Our time-lapse video microscopy studies showed that the cells displayed appropriate movement kinetics, albeit with low speed and directionality. Similarly, others have presented data consistent with slow movement of chondrocytes out of cartilage explants. It is important to decipher whether these in vitro movements reflect physiological states and if so, which events are simulated. Examples of in vivo studies that have inferred chondrocyte movements include those describing rotational or gliding movements of chondrocytes in the proliferative zone of the growth plate and its importance in the growth process; and the notion that chondrocytes move from the cartilage endplates to the nucleus pulposus (NP) in the spine of rabbits and rats during development. Such studies are consistent with the hypothesis that chondrocytes exhibit highly controlled and specialized movements during tissue growth and remodeling in vivo. On the other hand, the cartilage explant studies elicit interest in the possibility that matrix injuries resulting in disruption of the collagen network of adult cartilages provide a permissive environment for chondrocyte motility. Conclusions: The case for in vivo chondrocyte motility remains to be proven. However, the in vitro and in vivo data on chondrocyte movements present an argument for further thought and studies in this area. © 2007 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.},

An object's surface is defined implicitly as the zero set of an RBF fitted to the given surface data. Fast methods for fitting and evaluating RBFs allow us to model large data sets, consisting of millions of surface points, by a single RBF - previously an impossible task. A greedy algorithm in the fitting process reduces the number of RBF centers required to represent a surface and results in significant compression and further computational advantages. The energy-minimisation characterisation of polyharmonic splines result in a "smoothest" interpolant. This scale-independent characterisation is well-suited to reconstructing surfaces from non-uniformly sampled data. Holes are smoothly filled and surfaces smoothly extrapolated. We use a non-interpolating approximation when the data is noisy. The functional representation is in effect a solid model, which means that gradients and surface normals can be determined analytically. This helps generate uniform meshes and we show that the RBF representation has advantages for mesh simplification and remeshing applications.

Shapes with arbitrary topology are easily represented without the usual interpolation or aliasing errors arising from discrete sampling. These methods were first applied to implicit surfaces by Savchenko, et al. and later developed independently by Turk and O'Brien as a means of performing shape interpolation. Earlier approaches were limited as a modeling mechanism because of the order of the computational complexity involved. We explore and extend these implicit interpolating methods to make them suitable for systems of large numbers of scattered surface points by using compactly supported radial basis interpolants. The use of compactly supported elements generates a sparse solution space, reducing the computational complexity and making the technique practical for large models. The local nature of compactly supported radial basis functions permits the use of computational techniques and data structures such as k-d trees for spatial subdivision, promoting fast solvers and methods to divide and conquer many of the subproblems associated with these methods. Moreover, the representation of complex models permits the exploration of diverse surface geometry. This reduction in computational complexity enables the application of these methods to the study of shape properties of large complex shapes.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a new scalable parallelization scheme to generate the 3D Delaunay triangulation of a given set of points. Our first contribution is an efficient serial implementation of the incremental Delaunay insertion algorithm. A simple dedicated data structure, an efficient sorting of the points, and the optimization of the insertion algorithm have permitted to accelerate reference implementations by a factor three. Our second contribution is a multithreaded version of the Delaunay kernel that is able to concurrently insert vertices. Moore curve coordinates are used to partition the point set, avoiding heavy synchronization overheads. Conflicts are managed by modifying the partitions with a simple rescaling of the space-filling curve. The performances of our implementation have been measured on three different processors: an Intel core-i7, an Intel Xeon Phi, and an AMD EPYC, on which we have been able to compute three billion tetrahedra in 53 seconds. This corresponds to a generation rate of over 55 million tetrahedra per second. We finally show how this very efficient parallel Delaunay triangulation can be integrated in a Delaunay refinement mesh generator, which takes as input the triangulated surface boundary of the volume to mesh.},

   abstract = {Volumetric data is a convenient representation of shape on many occasions. One application area is remeshing, where a poorly trian- gulated model is converted to a volumetric representation and then transformed back into a model of better triangle quality. In certain areas, for example medical scans, volumetric data arise naturally. To render the shapes captured by such a scan, a common approach is to convert the volumetric data into a triangle mesh. Since both types of representations are valuable, it is interesting to find reliable and effi- cient ways of converting between them. Here, we will exclusively look at the conversion from volume data to triangle mesh. Many methods exist for performing such an operation, where one of the most popu- lar is Marching Cubes. The meshes resulting from this algorithm will however have properties often undesirable. Furthermore, the method is not applicable when storing the volumetric data in an adaptive structure, such as an octree. In this report, we will describe how meshes without these undesirable properties can be generated from an octree in a straightforward manner.},

   abstract = {We present an algorithm for out-of-core simplification of large polygonal datasets that are too complex to fit in main memory. The algorithm extends the vertex clustering scheme of Rossignac and Borrel [13] by using error quadric information for the placement of each cluster’s representative vertex, which better preserves fine details and results in a low mean geometric error. The use of quadrics instead of the vertex grading approach in [13] has the additional benefits of requiring less disk space and only a single pass over the model rather than two. The resulting linear time algorithm allows simplification of datasets of arbitrary complexity. In order to handle degenerate quadrics associated with (near) flat regions and regions with zero Gaussian curvature, we present a robust method for solving the corresponding underconstrained least-squares problem. The algorithm is able to detect these degeneracies and handle them gracefully. Key features of the simplification method include a bounded Hausdorff error, low mean geometric error, high simplification speed (up to 100,000 triangles/second reduction), output (but not input) sensitive memory requirements, no disk space overhead, and a running time that is independent of the order in which vertices and triangles occur in the mesh.},

   abstract = {Figure 1: A 134,400-tetrahedron mesh produced by isosurface stuffing, with cutaway views. At the lower right is a histogram of tetrahedron dihedral angles in 2 • intervals; multiply the heights of the red bars by 20. (Angles of 45 • , 60 • , and 90 • occur with high frequency.) The extreme dihedral angles are 15.2 • and 158.2 •. This mesh took 55 seconds to generate on a Mac Pro with a 2.66 GHz Intel Xeon processor, but the mesh generation time was only 642 milliseconds; nearly all the time was spent in the isosurface evaluation code. Abstract The isosurface stuffing algorithm fills an isosurface with a uniformly sized tetrahedral mesh whose dihedral angles are bounded between 10.7 • and 164.8 • , or (with a change in parameters) between 8.9 • and 158.8 •. The algorithm is whip fast, numerically robust , and easy to implement because, like Marching Cubes, it generates tetrahedra from a small set of precomputed stencils. A variant of the algorithm creates a mesh with internal grading: on the boundary , where high resolution is generally desired, the elements are fine and uniformly sized, and in the interior they may be coarser and vary in size. This combination of features makes isosurface stuffing a powerful tool for dynamic fluid simulation, large-deformation mechanics, and applications that require interactive remeshing or use objects defined by smooth implicit surfaces. It is the first algorithm that rigorously guarantees the suitability of tetrahedra for finite element methods in domains whose shapes are substantially more challenging than boxes. Our angle bounds are guaranteed by a computer-assisted proof. If the isosurface is a smooth 2-manifold with bounded curvature, and the tetrahedra are sufficiently small, then the boundary of the mesh is guaranteed to be a geometrically and topologically accurate approximation of the isosurface.},

It is based on simple geometric transformations, which, if applied iteratively, lead to the regularization of mesh elements. Global mesh smoothing can be accomplished by successively improving the worst elements or by averaging node positions obtained by the simultaneous transformation of all elements. GETMe smoothing has been successfully applied in the case of surface meshes. As shown in this paper, this approach also naturally extends to tetrahedral mesh smoothing without major conceptual modifications. A regularizing transformation for tetrahedra is presented and a combined approach of simultaneous and sequential GETMe smoothing is described. First numerical examples yield high quality meshes superior to those obtained by other geometry-based methods. In fact, the presented results are in a majority of cases at least comparable to those obtained by a state of the art global optimization-based method. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {A novel method for smoothing triangular surface meshes is presented. It is based on the Geometric Element Transformation Method (GETMe) representing a simple geometric operation. In contrast to existing smoothing techniques, GETMe transforms single elements thus resulting in a simultaneous movement of all nodes of an element. The effect of this transformation, if applied iteratively, is the asymptotical but rapid regularization of the initial element. Mesh smoothing is achieved by applying this transformation to every poor quality element until overall mesh quality reaches a user defined level. Thereby, a lower bound for the minimal element angle and an upper bound for the maximal element angle serve as natural control variables in order to freely adjust mesh quality with respect to subsequent applications. Descriptions of the basic smoothing algorithm as well as modifications to preserve shape and to incorporate constraints on nodes are given. Numerical experiments on both artificial and real world meshes demonstrate the method's potential and flexibility. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The simplest such algorithm is Laplacian smoothing, which moves grid points to the geometric center of incident vertices. Unfortunately, this method operates heuristically and can create invalid meshes or elements of worse quality than those contained in the original mesh. In contrast, optimization-based methods are designed to maximize some measure of mesh quality and are very effective at eliminating extremal angles in the mesh. These improvements come at a higher computational cost, however. In this article we propose four smoothing techniques that combine a smart variant of Laplacian smoothing with an optimization-based approach. Several numerical experiments are performed that compare the mesh quality and computational cost for each of the methods in two and three dimensions. We find that the combined approaches are very cost effective and yield high-quality meshes.},

These methods can, however, produce poorly shaped elements that cause the numerical solution to be less accurate and more difficult to compute. Fortunately, the shape of the elements can be improved through several mechanisms, including face- and edge-swapping techniques, which change local connectivity, and optimization-based mesh smoothing methods, which adjust mesh point location. We consider several criteria for each of these two methods and compare the quality of several meshes obtained by using different combinations of swapping and smoothing. Computational experiments show that swapping is critical to the improvement of general mesh quality and that optimization-based smoothing is highly effective in eliminating very small and very large angles. High-quality meshes are obtained in a computationally efficient manner by using optimization-based smoothing to improve only the worst elements and a smart variant of Laplacian smoothing on the remaining elements. Based on our experiments, we offer several recommendations for the improvement of tetrahedral meshes. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Our goal is to aggressively optimize the worst tetrahedra, with speed a secondary consideration. Mesh optimization methods often get stuck in bad local optima (poor-quality meshes) because their repertoire of mesh transformations is weak. We employ a broader palette of operations than any previous mesh improvement software. Alongside the best traditional topological and smoothing operations, we introduce a topological transformation that inserts a new vertex (sometimes deleting others at the same time). We describe a schedule for applying and composing these operations that rarely gets stuck in a bad optimum. We demonstrate that all three techniques - smoothing, vertex insertion, and traditional transformations - are substantially more effective than any two alone.

   abstract = {We propose a novel tetrahedral meshing technique that is unconditionally robust, requires no user interaction, and can directly convert a triangle soup into an analysis-ready volumetric mesh. The approach is based on several core principles: (1) initial mesh construction based on a fully robust, yet efficient, filtered exact computation (2) explicit (automatic or user-defined) tolerancing of the mesh relative to the surface input (3) iterative mesh improvement with guarantees, at every step, of the output validity. The quality of the resulting mesh is a direct function of the target mesh size and allowed tolerance: Increasing allowed deviation from the initial mesh and decreasing the target edge length both lead to higher mesh quality. Our approach enables "black-box" analysis, i.e. it allows to automatically solve partial differential equations on geometrical models available in the wild, offering a robustness and reliability comparable to, e.g., image processing algorithms, opening the door to automatic, large scale processing of real-world geometric data.},

Using a divide-and-conquer approach to generate inter-slice connectivity, we create a case table that defines triangle topology. The algorithm processes the 3D medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) illustrate the quality and functionality of marching cubes.

Our method builds on the TetWild algorithm, replacing the rational triangle insertion with a new incremental approach to construct and optimize the output mesh, interleaving triangle insertion and mesh optimization. Our approach makes it possible to maintain a valid floating-point tetrahedral mesh at all algorithmic stages, eliminating the need for costly constructions with rational numbers used by TetWild, while maintaining full robustness and similar output quality. This allows us to improve on TetWild in two ways. First, our algorithm is significantly faster, with running time comparable to less robust Delaunay-based tetrahedralization algorithms. Second, our algorithm is guaranteed to produce a valid tetrahedral mesh with floating-point vertex coordinates, while TetWild produces a valid mesh with rational coordinates which is not guaranteed to be valid after floating-point conversion. As a trade-off, our algorithm no longer guarantees that all input triangles are present in the output mesh, but in practice, as confirmed by our tests on the Thingi10k dataset, the algorithm always succeeds in inserting all input triangles.},

The surfaces of any primitive object (such as a cube, sphere or cylinder) can be approximated by polygons. Being abile to find the union, intersection or difference of these objects allows more interesting and complicated polygonal objects to be created. The algorithm presented here performs these set operations on objects constructed from convex polygons. These objects must bound a finite volume, but need not be convex. An object that results from one of these operations also contains only convex polygons, and bounds a finite volume; thus, it can be used in later combinations, allowing the generation of quite complicated objects.

   abstract = {The quality improvement in mesh optimisation techniques that preserve its connectivity are obtained by an iterative process in which each node of the mesh is moved to a new position that minimises a certain objective function. The objective function is derived from some quality measure of the local submesh , that is, the set of tetrahedra connected to the adjustable or free node . Although these objective functions are suitable to improve the quality of a mesh in which there are non- inverted elements, they are not when the mesh is tangled. This is due to the fact that usual objective functions are not defined on all R3 and they present several discontinuities and local minima that prevent the use of conventional optimisation procedures. Otherwise, when the mesh is tangled, there are local submeshes for which the free node is out of the feasible region , or this does not exist. In this paper we propose the substitution of objective functions having barriers by modified versions that are defined and regular on all R3. With these modifications, the optimisation process is also directly applicable to meshes with inverted elements, making a previous untangling procedure unnecessary. This simultaneous procedure allows to reduce the number of iterations for reaching a prescribed quality. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present several applications where it can be seen that our results clearly improve those obtained by other authors. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

Suitable voids are created in an existing grid in the regions of localization using a mesh motion algorithm that solves a fictitious elasticity problem. The voids are then filled with stacks of prisms that are subsequently tetrahedronized to yield a simplicial mesh. The mesh motion algorithm allows us to deal in a simple and effective manner with the problem of self-intersection of elements in concave regions of the model boundaries, and in the case of closely spaced model faces, avoiding the need for cross-over checks and complex grid correction procedures. The capabilities and performance of the proposed methodology are illustrated with the help of practical examples.},

@article{Blom2000,
   abstract = {This paper presents an investigation on the spring analogy. The spring analogy serves for deformation in a moving boundary problem. First, two different kinds of springs are discussed: the vertex springs and the segment springs. The vertex spring analogy is originally used for smoothing a mesh after mesh generation or refinement. The segment spring analogy is used for deformation of the mesh in a moving boundary problem. The difference between the two methods lies in the equilibrium length of the springs. By means of an analogy to molecular theory, the two theories are generalized into a single theory that covers both. The usual choice of the stiffness of the spring is clarified by the mathematical analysis of a representative one-dimensional configuration. The analysis shows that node collision is prevented when the stiffness is chosen as the inverse of the segment length. The observed similarity between elliptic grid generation and the spring analogy is also investigated. This investigation shows that both methods update the grid point position by a weighted average of the surrounding points in an iterative manner. The weighting functions enforce regularity of the mesh. Based on these considerations, several improvements on the spring analogy are developed. The principle of Saint Venant is circumvented by a boundary correction. The prevention of inversion of triangular elements is improved by semi-torsional springs. The numerical results show the superiority of the segment spring analogy over the vertex one for a small rotation of an NACA0012 mesh. The boundary correction allows for large deformation of the mesh, where the standard spring analogy fails. The final test is performed on a Navier-Stokes mesh. This mesh contains high aspect ratio mesh cells near the boundary. Large deformation of this mesh shows that the semi-torsional spring improvement is imperative to retain the validity of this mesh.

The two principal curvatures (taken as a pair) are more informative, but one would prefer a single shape indicator rather than a pair of numbers. Moreover, the shape indicator should preferably be independent of the size i.e. the amount of curvature, as distinct from the type of curvature. We propose two novel measures of local shape, the 'curvedness' and the 'shape index'. The curvedness is a positive number that specifies the amount of curvature, whereas the shape index is a number in the range [-1, +1] and is scale invariant. The shape index captures the intuitive notion of 'local shape' particularly well. The shape index can be mapped upon an intuitively natural colour scale. Two complementary shapes (like stamp and mould) map to complementary hues. The symmetrical saddle (which is very special because it is self-complementary) maps to white. When a surface is tinted according to this colour scheme, this induces an immediate perceptual segmentation of convex, concave, and hyperbolic areas. We propose it as a useful tool in graphics representation of 3D shape. © 1992.},
